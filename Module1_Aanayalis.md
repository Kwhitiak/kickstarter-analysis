# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this Analysis is to determine how successful Kickstarter campaigns were in reaching their funding goals by their launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysing the Outcomes Based on Launch Date, it has been concluded that May is the most desirbele month to launch a Kickstarter Campaign.  Kickstarter Campaigns launching in May also had a greater success of reaching goal due to the popularity of the month of May

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

After analysing the Outcomes of KickStarter Campaigns based on Goals, it was discovered that goals at less than $5000 had a higher chance of success than goals at above $5000. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    The biggest challenges I have encountered in creating this analysis project was determining which fields to use in the Pivot tables in order to obtain the results we were needing.  after much trial and error, my tables looked readable. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Two conclusion I can see in the Outcomes based on Launch date is that the month of May had the most successful Theater Kickstarter Campaigns.  May also had the most failed campaings but May was also the most popular launch date at 166 theater campaing Kickstarters.  


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    We can conclude, based on goals, that there was a much higher rate of success than failed projects.  Goals less than 1000 had a much higher chance of success than goals than above 1000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    I believe how well marketed the campaign was is a limiation of the dataset that can alter the analyitcs results.  If their campaign was not marketed then it would make it difficult to convince people to make a donation.  


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    A graph showing the number of backers to outcomes could give us a better picture of how many people were actually interested in something that became successful.  
    A table to show the Avg donation to outcomes could also show us the level of interest in projects.  It could gie us a glimpse of the average donations for successful/failed projects.
